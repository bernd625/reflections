How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

The amount of text is reduced significantly if not too many changes have happend in between.
Scanning the whole document is not necessary anymore, even it I do not remember exactly what I changed where.
Also the fact that the changes are right next to each other helps. No need to juggel with two windows.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Things can be tried out and easily reverted if they did not work as expected.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Pros:
- choose logical break points
- vary size of commit according to problem complexity

Cons:
- a crash save auto save can help a lot sometimes... can overwrite older versions to keep it simple

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

For some cases, like coding, it makes more sense to keep track of all the files together, since they are all related. If they are all independent, then it makes more sense to treat them seperately.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log gives the id of the commits with the comments the author wrote. That means good comments are essential.
git diff shows the differences between to commits. It shows which lines were added and which ones deleted

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Often it is necessary to change the code at many places to try out a new idea. Reverting these changes can be very tidious if it did not work.
